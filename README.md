# Supercar Hire — Website Design System

This prototype demonstrates a premium, performance-focused design for a supercar rental marketplace.
It includes a style guide, reusable components, and key flows: browse → car details → booking.

## Brand foundations
- **Personality:** Precision, confidence, adrenaline.
- **Tone:** Clear, direct, trustworthy. No gimmicks.
- **Motion:** Subtle, purposeful micro-interactions only.

## Information Architecture (IA)
- Primary: Browse cars • Host your car • How it works • Sign in
- Secondary (footer): About • Insurance & requirements • FAQ • Contact • Terms • Privacy

## Key flows
1. **Search/Browse:** Filter by make, price/day, seats.
2. **Car details:** Gallery, specs, price/day, location, host badge, availability.
3. **Booking:** Pick dates, see price breakdown, confirm.

## Accessibility
- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 on text, visible focus, keyboard nav.
- Semantics: Landmark regions, labels, alt text.

## Tech
- Static HTML/CSS/JS; framework-agnostic. Ready to port into Next.js/React.
